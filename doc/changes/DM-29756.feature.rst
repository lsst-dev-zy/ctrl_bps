* Add ``numberOfRetries`` option which specifies the maximum number of retries
  allowed for a job.
* Add ``memoryMultiplier`` option to allow for increasing the memory
  requirements automatically between retries for jobs which exceeded memory
  during their execution. At the moment this option is only supported by
  HTCondor plugin.
